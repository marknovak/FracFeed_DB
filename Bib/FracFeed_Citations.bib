	abstract = {Many life-history events in aquatic invertebrates are triggered by seasonal changes in water temperature, but other ecological factors may be important as well. To rule out the confounding effects of changing water temperature, we studied the seasonal dynamics of an aquatic invertebrate community and their effect on a top fish predator in a thermally stable freshwater spring in South Iceland. We sampled benthic invertebrates five times over a year and conducted a mark-recapture study on the top predator in the system, small benthic Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.). We assessed variation in diet composition and feeding preferences by calculating the electivity and individual specialisation of each fish at each sampling time. There was a clear separation of winter and summer communities for the benthic invertebrates. The variation in prey availability was also reflected in the fish diet, with higher feeding selectivity in summer than in winter for the highly abundant Chironomidae larvae. In contrast, individual specialisation as a measure of intrapopulation niche variation was higher in winter when prey availability was lower. We furthermore found that groundwater amphipods might play an important role in the winter diet of spring-dwelling Arctic charr. In conclusion, seasonal variation in the invertebrate community is an important factor to consider and has the potential to alter the phenotype (e.g. growth rates) and behaviour (e.g. feeding preferences) of higher trophic levels.},

@article{Garrido:2021aa,
	abstract = {Sea stars often function as keystone predators in food webs of intertidal and subtidal communities, especially in temperate and sub-polar regions. In South America the sea star Cosmasterias lurida is distributed along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Patagonia and is one of the most conspicuous and abundant benthic predators in the shallow subtidal zone (<25 m). Its feeding strategy and prey selection are, however, still poorly known. This study describes the feeding behavior of C. lurida at a site in the Seno del Reloncav{\'\i} (Chile), assessing its abundance, size and prey selection in the field relative to observed prey abundance and size along a bathymetric gradient. We hypothesized that C. lurida is a generalist predator, feeding on suitable prey according to their availability. However, we found that this predator only consumed a limited number (7 of 48) of potential prey species, primarily the slipper limpets Crepipatella spp. and the mussels Aulacomya ater and Mytilus chilensis. Electivity analysis revealed a clear preference for one mussel (A. ater) but not the other (M. chilensis) as well as depth-dependent selectivity for the slipper limpets, which changed from avoidance to preference with increasing depth. Sea star densities varied with depth, peaking between depths of 5 and 10 m, but the size of sea stars and the size of their prey did not vary significantly along a depth gradient. No significant correlations were found with the most commonly selected prey. These results would indicate that while this predator may be a generalist--opportunist, its feeding behavior is context-dependent and its high selectivity for certain species suggests that this sea star plays a key role structuring subtidal benthic communities in Patagonia.},

The diets of the two species were 86.6% similar, with four of five top prey categories in common. The most numerically important prey items for both species were adult dipterans and coleopterans and winged hymenopterans. Desmognathus welteri consumed a larger percentage of aquatic prey. No salamander remains were found in the stomachs of either species, weakening the supposition that large desmognathines are significant predators on small ones. We suggest that the differences in diet are a result of differences in microhabitat use and body size.},

@article{Fanelli:2004wy,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The feeding habits of 4 species of <i>Plesionika </i>inhabiting the Alboran Sea (SW Mediterranean) at depths between 29 and 790 m were analyzed. Included within the trophic guild of non-migratory macroplankton feeders, <i>Plesionika</i> spp. preferably exploited mesopelagic resources (mainly euphausiids and Myctophidae). Deep-bathyal species (<i>P. martia</i>, <i>P. gigliolii</i> and <i>P. edwardsi</i>) fitted better within this guild, while the shallower living species <i>P. heterocarpus, </i>which inhabits the shelf-slope break, consumed benthic organisms (e.g. polychaetes, bivalves and tanaids). In a multi-species MDS analysis, diets of <i>P. martia</i> and <i>P. heterocarpus</i> were grouped as a function of depth. Latitude, phytoplankton pigment (PP) concentration recorded 4 wk before the sampling date (PP4) and depth were the explanatory variables of stomach fullness of <i>Plesionika </i>(all species: R<sup>2 </sup>= 0.674 in a multiple linear regression model, MLR). The abundance of <i>P. martia</i> also showed a positive significant correlation (Spearman r) with PP4. Possible causes of higher shrimp aggregations in <i>P. martia</i> could be related to reproductive processes because peaks of mature females were reported at similar periods in neighboring areas. In both dominant <i>Plesionika</i> species (<i>P. martia</i> and <i>P. heterocarpus</i>), MDS dimensions for diets were also correlated with PP4, although significant correlations with other PP data taken at different periods (from simultaneous PP data to PP6, 6 wk before sampling) were also found. These trends suggest that macroplankton-feeder Pandalidae may couple some aspects of their biology with blooms of plankton and ultimately with peaks of primary production. Prey size selection occurred among <i>Plesionika </i>spp., which suggested a hunting activity. Correlations between <i>Plesionika</i> spp. size (<i>CL</i>, mm) and prey size were positive, both for fish (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.437) and for euphausiids (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.440). Otolith length (mainly of <i>Benthosema glaciale</i>) and the size of euphausiid mandibles (<i>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</i> and <i>Euphausia hemigibba</i>) increased with predator size. Further evidence of active predation by deep pandalids, for example changes in the daily feeding activity of species, were evidenced for <i>P. martia</i> with higher foregut fullness at the beginning of the daytime period (from 06:00 to 08:00 h) related to predation on euphausiids. },

The principal food was copepodite stage V of Calanus and females of Calanus and Pseudocalanus. Analysis of daytime and night data with reference to length of migratory alterations of Sagitta populations and gut passage time indicates that they feed actively in the layers of day$\lnot$time plankton accumulations. Total food consumption during time spent in the subsurface layers ranged from 0.025-0.097 cal/indiv. in 12 h, equivalent to 37-143{\%} of their metabolic energy expenditure. Over the course of 12 h Sagitta population consumes 0.3-5{\%} and 0.5-6{\%} of population of stage V copepodites and females of Calanus and Pseudocalanus females, respectively.},

	abstract = {This study assesses the effects of commercial trawling on benthic fauna, by analysing differences in the population structure and diet of benthic organisms inhabiting fishing grounds. The study is focused on two epifaunal species collected from a fishing ground in the north-western Mediterranean, which included a portion of un-trawled seabed used as a reference of undisturbed community. The selected species were the flatfish Citharus linguatula, more abundant at the undisturbed site and previously characterised as a surface predator and vulnerable to trawling, and the starfish Astropecten irregularis, which dominated the epibenthic community and had been characterised as an opportunistic species with low vulnerability to trawling. Both species were selective feeders and ingested similar prey species at each of the two sites, although differences in the relative prey abundance found in the stomachs occurred between sites. A. irregularis at the fished site mainly ingested gastropods, whereas higher proportion of bivalves was ingested at the undisturbed site. C. linguatula diet mainly composed of crustaceans at both sites, but there was an increase in the ingestion of small fish at the fished site. Moreover, prey ingestion of these two species generally increased with fishing activity. Trawling appears to modify the diet of these two species in terms of relative abundance of ingested prey, nevertheless, increased opportunism due to trawling disturbance was not detected and the density of these predators over fishing grounds was more closely related to their vulnerability to trawling.},

Parasitic copepods were present in 70% of the stomachs of Remora remora containing food and in four other species to a lesser, but significant extent. The growth stage of the life history of the echeneid during which it feeds on parasites varies among species. In R. remora the younger individuals are more active as parasite pickers whereas in R. osteochir older specimens are more active. Life history information resulting from extensive collection data is included in the discussion of each of the six species considered.},

@article{Connell:1970vu,
	abstract = {On San Juan Island, Washington, three species of intertidal barnacles (Balanus glandula, Balanus cariosus and Chthamalus fissus) are the main prey of several species of predators, the commonest being three species of snails, Thais emarginata, Thais canaliculata and Thais lamellosa. Larvae of B. glandula settle throughout the intertidal zone but, except in quiet bays, survive to maturity only in a narrow zone at the top of the shore. In quiet bays, where predators of barnacles were scarce, and in areas of turbulent water where predators were excluded by other circumstances, adult B. glandula occurred over the whole intertidal zone. From the lower part of the intertidal zone. Predators were evidently eliminating all B. glandula from the lower part of the intertidal zone. The rates of feeding of Thais lamellosa and Thais emarginata were measured in cages on the shore. The existing population of Thais could account for all of the mortality of B. glandula which occurred at low shore levels in mid and late summer. By late autumn these predators could eat all the remaining B. glandula of that year's settlement at low levels, but at upper shore levels the Thais population could not account for all the mortality of B. glandula in summer. The Thais populations shift upwards from the lower shore levels in the autumn and it is very probable that this increased predation is enough to eliminate the barnacles at the middle and upper shore within the next year. The recruitment of B. glandula every year was quite regular. The breeding population in the narrow 'refuge' zone at the top of the intertidal zone was capable of replacing itself as well as colonizing the middle and lower shore. The settlement below the refuge zone can be regarded simply as a regular food supply for the predator population. Because of the dependability of this food supply at upper shore levels, a predator, T. emarginata, has evolved to specialize at these upper levels. In Scotland, where the recruitment of barnacles is irregular, no such specialization is possible. Thus at least two species of predators are supported at different shore levels at San Juan Island, whereas only one species occupies the whole intertidal shore in Scotland. In Scotland, much of the mortality of young barnacles was caused by intraspecific crowding in dense populations, and these deaths provide food for scavengers, rather than predators. In contrast, at San Juan Island of the mortality of young barnacles is caused by predators. Thus the predators at San Juan Island are more efficient than those in Scotland, since they eat a much higher proportion of the available prey. Whereas in Scotland the distribution and abundance of barnacles is largely determined by competition for space, at San Juan Island the barnacles is largely determined by competition for space, at San Juan Island the barnacles are limited by predation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents data on the diet of the squid, Loligo vulgaris (Lamarck, 1799) from the south coast of Portugal (Algarve) and from the Saharan Bank (Central-East Atlantic). A total of 964 squid was collected from the Algarve coast, between March 1993 and October 1994, from bottom trawling. An additional sample of 70 stomachs was obtained in the Algarve coast from the hand jigging fishery during 1991 and 1992. In the Saharan Bank, 848 squid were obtained, between June 1993 and January 1994, with bottom trawling. Stomachs with contents for trawled squid from the Algarve coast, and the Saharan Bank represented 28.1{\%} and 40.8{\%}, respectively. Fish was always the main component of the diet in both regions, representing 88.6{\%} of the total weight of the prey found in the stomachs, for the Algarve coast, and 70.9{\%} for the Saharan Bank. The occurrence percentage and the percentage in number indicated that Trachurus trachurus and fish belonging to the family Gobiidae were the most frequent fish found in the Algarve samples, while flatfish were the most common fish in the Saharan Bank samples. Loligo vulgaris was the dominant cephalopod found in the stomachs for both regions. No differences in the diet were found between males and females. The comparison between immature and mature squid showed that the importance of fish was higher in mature squid, for both regions. The squid captured from the Algarve coast by bottom trawling (at greater depths and offshore) fed primarily on fish, while those captured with hand jigging (inshore, at lower depths) contained an important percentage of crustaceans.},

The seasonal variation in the diet was related directly to food availability, which, in turn, was dictated by natural cycles of prey in the region. The frequency with which plastic particles were found in the stomachs also had a statistically significant seasonal trend. Fish provided the largest energy contribution (75-91%) to the diet at all times in the region. There was no significant difference between diets of juvenile and adult birds.},

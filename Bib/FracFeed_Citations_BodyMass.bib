@article{Smith:2003aa,
	abstract = {The purpose of this data set was to compile body mass information for all mammals on Earth so that we could investigate the patterns of body mass seen across geographic and taxonomic space and evolutionary time. We were interested in the heritability of body size across taxonomic groups (How conserved is body mass within a genus, family, and order?), in the overall pattern of body mass across continents (Do the moments and other descriptive statistics remain the same across geographic space?), and over evolutionary time (How quickly did body mass patterns iterate on the patterns seen today? Were the Pleistocene extinctions size specific on each continent, and did these events coincide with the arrival of man?). These data are also part of a larger project that seeks to integrate body mass patterns across very diverse taxa (NCEAS Working Group on Body Size in Ecology and Paleoecology: linking pattern and process across space, time, and taxonomic scales). We began with the updated version of D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder's taxonomic list of all known Recent mammals of the world (N = 4629 species) to which we added status, distribution, and body mass estimates compiled from the primary and secondary literature. Whenever possible, we used an average of male and female body mass, which was in turn averaged over multiple localities to arrive at our species body mass values. The sources are line referenced in the main data set, with the actual references appearing in a table within the metadata. Mammals have individual records for each continent they occur on. Note that our data set is more than an amalgamation of smaller compilations. Although we relied heavily on a data set for Chiroptera by K. E. Jones (N = 905), the CRC handbook of Mammalian Body Mass (N = 688), and a data set compiled for South America by P. Marquet (N = 505), these represent less than half the records in the current database. The remainder are derived from more than 150 other sources. Furthermore, we include a comprehensive late Pleistocene species assemblage for Africa, North and South America, and Australia (an additional 230 species). ``Late Pleistocene'' is defined as approximately 11 ka for Africa, North and South America, and as 50 ka for Australia, because these times predate anthropogenic impacts on mammalian fauna. Estimates contained within this data set represent a generalized species value, averaged across sexes and geographic space. Consequently, these data are not appropriate for asking population-level questions where the integration of body mass with specific environmental conditions is important. All extant orders of mammals are included, as well as several archaic groups (N = 4859 species). Because some species are found on more than one continent (particularly Chiroptera), there are 5731 entries. We have body masses for the following: Artiodactyla (280 records), Bibymalagasia (2 records), Carnivora (393 records), Cetacea (75 records), Chiroptera (1071 records), Dasyuromorphia (67 records), Dermoptera (3 records), Didelphimorphia (68 records), Diprotodontia (127 records), Hydracoidea (5 records), Insectivora (234 records), Lagomorpha (53 records), Litopterna (2 records), Macroscelidea (14 records), Microbiotheria (1 record), Monotremata (7 records), Notoryctemorphia (1 record), Notoungulata (5 records), Paucituberculata (5 records), Peramelemorphia (24 records), Perissodactyla (47 records), Pholidota (8 records), Primates (276 records), Proboscidea (14 records), Rodentia (1425 records), Scandentia (15 records), Sirenia (6 records), Tubulidentata (1 record), and Xenarthra (75 records).},

	n2 = {Summary A Bayesian hierarchical approach is presented for the estimation of length-weight relationships (LWR) in fishes. In particular, estimates are provided for the LWR parameters a and b in general as well as by body shape. These priors and existing LWR studies were used to derive species-specific LWR parameters. In the case of data-poor species, the analysis includes LWR studies of closely related species with the same body shape. This approach yielded LWR parameter estimates with measures of uncertainty for practically all known 32 000 species of fishes. Provided is a large LWR data set extracted from www.fishbase.org, the source code of the respective analyses, and ready-to-use tools for practitioners. This is presented as an example of a self-learning online database where the addition of new studies improves the species-specific parameter estimates, and where these parameter estimates inform the analysis of new data.},

	abstract = {Feeding rates and selection of the oyster drill Urosalpinx cinerea were investigated with several long term temperature alteration experiments. Oyster drill prey selection was assessed in terms of prey (oyster) size and shell thickness. Drills fed on oysters with thinner shells 86% of the time and selectively preyed on smaller (1g wet weight) oysters during colder months and larger (10g wet weight) oysters during warmer months. Analysis of U. cinerea seasonal feeding patterns showed virtually no feeding during winter months (January to March) and a significant increase to over 1 gram of prey tissue per week during summer (July to September). A nine month experiment compared feeding rates of U. cinerea at two different temperature levels: ambient seawater (control) and temperatures elevated 4$\,^{\circ}$C above ambient. Oyster drills showed a 60% increase in feeding rate in the warmer treatment, especially during late summer, fall and early winter. Both temperature manipulation and annual feeding experiments revealed a significant temperature dependence of U. cinerea feeding rates. Seasonal or long-term seawater temperature changes related to climate change could strongly affect the predator--prey relationship between U. cinerea and its prey.},
